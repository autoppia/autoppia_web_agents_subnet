If every subsystem in the provided logs appears healthy, output exactly:

All good

Otherwise, respond in plain text (no Markdown) with:
1) A short, human-readable title naming the issue.
2) A single concise paragraph describing what went wrong and the concrete evidence (timestamps, validator_round ids, HTTP status, error text, etc.). Keep it under 4 sentences.
3) One recommended action phrased as “Recommendation: …”, focused on the next best remediation step.

Do not include anything else. If multiple issues exist, pick the highest-impact one and report only that. Do not invent evidence—if you are uncertain, treat the system as healthy and reply “All good”.
